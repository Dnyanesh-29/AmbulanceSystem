Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

his project is designed to help emergency vehicles‚Äîlike ambulances, fire engines, and police cars‚Äîmove through traffic faster and more safely in urban areas. It combines a smart web app that gives real-time navigation and live location sharing with traffic officers, and a transmitter-receiver system that automatically turns traffic lights green as the emergency vehicle approaches.
It's built for emergency responders who need faster access during crises, and for traffic authorities who coordinate clear passage. The system ultimately aims to save lives by reducing delays and creating safer, more responsive cities.

## üîå Hardware Connections

### üì° RF Receiver (RH_ASK)

| Pin | Arduino |
|-----|---------|
| VCC | 5V      |
| GND | GND     |
| Data | A0     |

### üìü I2C LCD Display

| Pin | Arduino UNO |
|-----|-------------|
| VCC | 5V          |
| GND | GND         |
| SDA | A4          |
| SCL | A5          |

### üö¶ Traffic Signals (LEDs + Resistors)

Each signal (Red, Yellow, Green) should have a 220Œ©‚Äì330Œ© resistor in series.

| Signal | Red Pin | Yellow Pin | Green Pin |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 1      | D8      | D9         | D10       |
| 2      | D11     | D12        | D13       |

Tranmitter side connection <br/>
To document the hardware setup for this Arduino-based RF **transmitter circuit**, you can add the following Markdown section to your `README.md` file:

## üì° Transmitter Circuit Connections

This transmitter module sends a signal when the button is pressed, simulating an ambulance's presence and triggering traffic control actions on the receiver side.

### üîß Pin Configuration

| Component         | Arduino Pin | Notes                           |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| RF Transmitter   | N/A (built into RH_ASK) | Connected internally via `RH_ASK driver` |
| Ambulance Red LED   | D6          | Blinks when transmitter is ON   |
| Ambulance Green LED | D7          | Alternates with red LED         |
| Button (Toggle)  | D8          | Use `INPUT_PULLUP`, active LOW  |

> **Tip:** Connect the other leg of the button to **GND**, and ensure LEDs have 220Œ©‚Äì330Œ© resistors in series.
