Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

his project is designed to help emergency vehicles—like ambulances, fire engines, and police cars—move through traffic faster and more safely in urban areas. It combines a smart web app that gives real-time navigation and live location sharing with traffic officers, and a transmitter-receiver system that automatically turns traffic lights green as the emergency vehicle approaches.
It's built for emergency responders who need faster access during crises, and for traffic authorities who coordinate clear passage. The system ultimately aims to save lives by reducing delays and creating safer, more responsive cities.
